# Filtering Products

Check the [DEMO](https://steady-sherbet-6b99d9.netlify.app/)

### To check the project locally
``git clone & npm i``

### Technologies Used
React - Typescript - AXIOS & SWR (to fetch data) - SASS - Tailwind CSS - HeroIcons - Netlify(for hosting Demo)

I used [mockAPI](https://mockapi.io/docs) to generate the data for the products and fetched them with AXIOS & SWR.
